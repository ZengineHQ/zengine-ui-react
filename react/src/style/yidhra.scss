// First import our variable overrides.
@import "variables";

// Then import base Bootstrap theme variables.
// This is done as a separate step so we can update the Bootswatch theme which consists of this and the bootswatch import.
@import "vendor/variables";

// The import actual Bootstrap styles.
@import "vendor/bootstrap";

// Then import Bootswatch variables.
// Again, this is done as a separate step so we can update this import if and when an update comes out and keep our stuff.
// These 3 bootstrap imports have to go in this order: theme vars -> bootstrap -> theme styles.
@import "vendor/bootswatch";

// Finally add our own custom styles.
// These are additional styles for our atomic design elements that are not covered by Bootstrap.
@import "custom";
